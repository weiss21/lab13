#Lab 13-Madlibs
#Team 10 - M. Mariscal, C. Piwarski, W. Robleh



#Step 1: Find a news article online
#You only need between 100 and 200 words for a decent mad lib, so if you find 
#a really long story, take only part of it.  
#Step 2: Remove some words
#Go through the article and turn it into strings in Python and remove some of 
#the words.  These will be the words that become part of the Mad Lib Game

#Step 3: Make some design decision
#You need to think about how you are going to ask the user to enter the words, 
#how you are going to store the words entered, and how you are going to print 
#out the restulting story.  There are several different ways to accomplish this
#using strings and lists. The one rule is that you cannot use a separate 
#variable for every word you need.

#Step 4: Collect words from the user
#Prompt the user to enter the words that you need to fill in your mad lib 

# just an idea, the type of words you need to fill in could be another list
wordsNeeded = ['plural noun', 'event', 'something you walk down', \
'generic place', 'plural animals', 'plural noun', 'Actor from a TV Show',\
'Actor']

# then you can collect their madlib words with a loop. collect all the answers 
# in a list for later.
solutionList = []
for word in wordsNeeded:
  answer = requestString('Please type in: %s' % word)
  solutionList.append(answer)

#Step 5: Print the results
#Combine the original text plus the new words to print your final mad lib.   
newString = ''
for i in range (len(solutionList)):
  newString += myList[i] + ' ' + solutionList[i]
newString += myList[-1]
print newString
